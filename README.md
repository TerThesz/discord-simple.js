## Usage

First of all, you need to install this package. You can do so

using npm: <br/>

```
npm install discord-simple.js
```

or using yarn: <br/>

```
yarn add discord-simple.js
```

<br/>

other instructions can be found in the [documentation (coming soon)](https://google.com)

## Example

Here is an example of how to make a simple bot using this package:

###### src/index.js

```javascript
const { SimpleClient } = require('discord-simple.js');

const client = new SimpleClient('token', 'client_id').load_commands();

// you can add your code here as you would in discord.js

client.login();
```

###### src/commands/ping.js

```javascript
const { SimpleCommand } = require('discord-simple.js');

module.exports = class PingCommand extends SimpleCommand {
  name = 'ping';
  description = 'Ping command';

  async execute(interaction, client) {
    interaction.reply('üèì pong');
  }
};
```

<br/>

As you might have noticed, this library is not efficient for simple bots like this. However, it introduces a great advantage when making a bigger and/or more complex bot.

## About

I made this package to help other developers (but mainly myself) to make discord bots faster without the need to copy and paste or google code all the time.

<br/>

This package:

- uses the [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) v13 library made by Discord.
- has a full support for TypeScript.
- is still in development. More changes will be made in the near future.
